# Flickity-Cards
Custom Cards in a slider using Flickity Slider

This project's purpose is to test and implement cards using the Flickity Slider. It's a good way to try and learn responsive design for a card based UI for a To-Do app and learning how the UI varies from device to device. The UI is purposely made to resemble a phone screen and not stretch on wide screen, since it is meant to be part of a larger mobile app project using cross-platform implementation.
